# YOLOv3-Object-Detection

This project implements an image and video object detection classifier using pretrained yolov3 models. The yolov3 models are taken from the official yolov3 paper which was released in 2018. The yolov3 implementation is from darknet. Also, this project implements an option to perform classification real-time using the webcam.

Note: This works considering you have the weights and config files at the  directory.
If the files are located somewhere else then mention the path while calling the main.py.
 one more thing here,because of heavy weighted file github not supported to allow the file,for download the weights click below link nd add to your path.
